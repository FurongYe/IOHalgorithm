# IOHalgorithm

This repository includes implementation of algorithms based on __IOHexperimenter__. __IOHexperimenter__ is a benchmarking platform for Iterative Optimization Heuristics, which is a part of __IOHanalyzer__. With data generated by __IOHexperimenter__, you can easily have performance analyze for your algorithm using __IOHanalyzer__

* For introduction of __IOHexperimenter__, please visit [https://github.com/IOHprofiler/IOHexperimenter](https://github.com/IOHprofiler/IOHexperimenter).
* For usage of __IOHanalyzer__, please visit [github page](https://github.com/IOHprofiler/IOHanalyzer) or the [online host](http://iohprofiler.liacs.nl).
* For details of the __IOHanalyzer__ project, please visit the [wiki page](https://iohprofiler.github.io).
* For reference of algorithm, please find in the paper[Benchmarking discrete optimization heuristics with IOHprofiler](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3326810).
